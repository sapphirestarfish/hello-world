Hi, I am sapphirestarfish, also known as Nico. I am a linguist by training, and my research specialty is second language acquisition of syntax and argument structure. In the course of working on my dissertation I became independently interested in the data science and data visualization communities. I am currently working mainly with R and SQL. I love the world of open source software and data sharing projects like OSF.
